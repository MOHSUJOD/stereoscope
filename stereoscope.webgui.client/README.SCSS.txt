To compile scss into css do the following:

Install Ruby (already integrated in OSX) for Windows from
http://rubyinstaller.org/

Install the compass gem from commandline:
$ gem install compass

And 'Sassy Buttons', too:
$ gem install sassy-buttons

Add an ant automatic builder described here:

After that, changes on the sass files will automatically trigger the compiler.
